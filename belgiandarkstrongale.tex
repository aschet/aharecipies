\chapter*{Easter Quad}

\begin{aboutblock}
Michael Tonsmeire has made a name for himself in the beer world -- especially
with sour beers. However, in his Brewer of the Week post, he shared a not-so-sour
Easter Quad recipe he brewed with his neighbor, a priest, for a church's Easter Vigil.
Tonsmeire was expecting a light wheat beer, but instead was excited when his neighbor
wanted to brew a Belgian Quad with a couple ingredients mentioned in the Bible
(pomegranate and cardamom). Needless to say, it turned out delicious.
