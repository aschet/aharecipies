\begin{aboutblock}
Recipe courtesy Jackie O's Pub \& Brewery, Athens, Ohio.
In May 2007, Art Oestrike's brother Brian Oestrike summited Mount Everest
to raise money for the LUNG\-evity Foundation, a lung cancer-focused nonprofit.
Art and Brian's mother, Jackie, had passed away from lung cancer on June 14, 2006.
As Newcastle Brown Ale was a favorite of Jackie's (who was born in England),
then-brewer Brad Clark created the recipe for Chomolungma as an American
interpretation of the British classic. The beer was named for the word Tibetans
use for Mount Everest, which means "Goddess Mother of the Earth."
